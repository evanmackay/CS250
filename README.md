### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs can be understood by trying to understand what a user might expect from your program, or by asking a user directly what they expect from a program. This information can then be broken down into the actions that need to be taken to get a desired result, and what the desired result is. Creating a "user story" allows us to break this process into seperate pieces and allows for development and testing teams to have a clear understanding of the missions statement and end goals in a project.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Program development requires that we plan, develop, test, implement, maintain, and retire our code. While there are many approaches to the software development lifecycle, Agile-Scrum processes allow for organizations to communicate and collaborate effectively, and deliver functioning products consistantly.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team in software development requires you to deliver on time and to expect to help and be helped in your work. While you may be a good programmer, you don't know everything. While other programmers may have more experience than you, they don't know everything. Successful development relies on collaboration and team work to deliver functioning products to users on a consistent basis. If a team member can't deliver their work on time and won't ask for help, or help others when they need it, they are not a good team member.
